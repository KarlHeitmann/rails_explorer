# rails_explorer

This project is part of my series of rust explorers: [rg_explorer](https://github.com/KarlHeitmann/rg_explorer) and [git_explorer](https://github.com/KarlHeitmann/git_explorer) 

## routes explorer feature

Go to your rails project, run the command:

> rails routes > routes.txt

Copy the `routes.txt` file to the root folder of your `rails_explorer` clone and run

> cargo run

To run the application and parse the `routes.txt` file so you can explore the routes of your application.
